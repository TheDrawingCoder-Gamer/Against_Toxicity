# Against Toxicity is finally here!

### Tired of the needless toxicity and hate that the PvP community is constantly spreading? Cope no more! _Against Toxicity_ is a simple chat bot that will automatically remind people to be nice, whenever they're being toxic!
## Features:
- Toggle default to private messaging (good for servers with a strict anti-spam policy)
- Configure which servers to automatically message players in private
- Friends list: ignores friends being toxic
- Self censoring, to help you become a less toxic person as well
